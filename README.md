## Plugin-free video calls in your browser using WebRTC

VMUX is a Skypeâ„¢ alternative that runs in the browser. It's built on top of WebRTC so you don't need to install any plugins or use Flash. You can do one-to-one or multi-party video calls and all the communications are P2P and encrypted.

You can try it at [https://vmux.co](https://vmux.co)
